# Dynamic Topological Data Analysis (TDA)

This is the material for the Python tutorial on Dynamic TDA that will be given at the 20th IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI 2023), organized jointly by the IEEE Signal Processing Society and the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society, which will be held in Cartagena de Indias, Colombia, April 18-21, 2023.

To make this tutorial on Dynamic TDA as friendly as possible, we base it on the Scikit-TDA project. More specifically, we will use the Ripser and Persim libraries as the backbone of our code.

The outline of the tutorial is as follows:
- Persistence homology (PH) on point cloud data with persistence diagrams (PDs)
- Wasserstein and Bottleneck distance computations between PDs
- Persistence landscapes (PLs)
- Time delay (TDE) and sliding window (SWE) embeddings for time series data
- Application to Epileptic Seizure EEG data set

This TDA tutorial is user friendly and aims to illustrate the key concepts behind dynamic TDA. It includes multiple examples with simulated data sets, such as the sphere or a torus.
