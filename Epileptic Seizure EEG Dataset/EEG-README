EEG 

Data is collected from an epileptic patient at the 
Epilepsy Disorder Laboratory at the University of 
Michigan. Primary investigator is: Beth Malow, M.D.

The dataset here is a time-truncated version of the 
EEGs that were used for analysis in the following 
papers: 

Automatic Statistical Analysis of Bivariate Non-Stationary 
Time Series, Journal of the American Statistical Association, 
2001, 96, 543-560. (Authors: Ombao, H., Raz, J., von Sachs, R., 
Malow, B.)

Improved Time-Frequency Analysis of Multi-channel EEG 
Using the SLEX Method, IEEE Transactions of Biomedical 
Engineering, 2002, accepted for publication. (Authors: Cranstoun, S., 
Ombao, H., von Sachs, R., Guo, W. and Litt, B.)

Facts about the EEG dataset:

sampling rate 100Hz
scalp electrodes
they are differential electrodes (no reference)
the correspondence channel - electrode is:

We have 2 matrices, namely eeg_noseiz and eeg_seiz

eeg_noseiz = non-seizure part of the EEG
eeg_seiz = seizure part of the EEG

Each matrix has T=128 rows and 21 columns. The j-th 
column is the EEG recorded at the j-th electrode 
channel. See reference below for electrode placement. 
We have T=128 time points at each of the channel 
recording below.

For further reference: the EEG signal was sampled at 
the rate of 100 Hertz.
